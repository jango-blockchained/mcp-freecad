2. Improve test coverage
3. Code quality enhancements
4. Documentation updates
5. Performance optimizations

## Implementation Plan
- [✅] Phase 1: Code refactoring (massive files)
- [✅] Phase 2: Test coverage expansion
- [✅] Phase 3: Code quality improvements
- [✅] Phase 4: Configuration optimizations
- [✅] Phase 5: Development workflow improvements

## Progress Log

### Phase 1: Code Refactoring ✅
**Massive File Breakdown (freecad_mcp_server.py: 1,510 lines → Modular Components)**

#### Created Components:
- `components/config.py`: Configuration management (81 lines)
- `components/logging_setup.py`: Logging infrastructure (83 lines)
- `components/connection_manager.py`: FreeCAD connection handling (93 lines)
- `components/progress_tracker.py`: Progress reporting system (47 lines)
- `components/utils.py`: Sanitization and validation utilities (49 lines)
- `freecad_mcp_server_refactored.py`: Clean main server file (102 lines)

#### Benefits:
- **Maintainability**: Each component has single responsibility
- **Testability**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
- **Reusability**: Components can be used independently
- **Readability**: Clear separation of concerns

### Phase 2: Test Coverage Expansion ✅
#### Created Comprehensive Tests:
- `tests/components/test_config.py`: Configuration management tests
- `tests/components/test_utils.py`: Utility function tests  
- `tests/test_server_integration.py`: Integration tests
- Added pytest configuration with coverage reporting

#### Test Categories:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for component interaction
- Edge case and error condition testing
- Async functionality testing

### Phase 3: Code Quality Improvements ✅
#### Enhanced Configuration:
- Fixed .flake8 inconsistencies with pyproject.toml
- Updated pytest configuration with coverage and markers
- Added comprehensive pre-commit hooks
- Standardized code formatting rules

#### Quality Tools Added:
- Black (code formatting)
- isort (import sorting)
- flake8 (linting)
- mypy (type checking)
- pre-commit (automated quality checks)

### Phase 4: Configuration Optimizations ✅
#### Improved pytest Configuration:
- Added coverage reporting (HTML + terminal)
- Configured test markers for categorization
- Strict configuration validation
- Enhanced test discovery

### Phase 5: Development Workflow Improvements ✅
#### Pre-commit Configuration:
- Automated code formatting
- Import sorting
- Linting checks
- Type checking
- YAML/JSON validation
- Large file detection
