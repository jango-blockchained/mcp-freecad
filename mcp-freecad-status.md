# MCP-FreeCAD Status Report

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Fixed MCP Server Initialization
- Fixed the `main()` function in `freecad_mcp_server.py` to properly handle async execution
- Added improved error handling to the server start method
- Fixed the MCP server to use the correct API for handling client connections
- The server now successfully connects to FreeCAD using the server method

### 2. Fixed Package Installation
- Updated `setup.py` to include all Python modules in the project
- Added the proper console script entry point for the `mcp-freecad` command
- Successfully installed the package in development mode
- Created symbolic link in `/usr/local/bin/mcp-freecad` for global access

### 3. Added Various Helper Scripts
- Created `fix-mcp-server.py` to fix the MCP server code
- Created `fix-setup.py` to fix the setup.py file and test installation
- Created shell scripts for easier execution:
  - `mcp-freecad.sh`: Direct script runner
  - `mcp-freecad-installer.sh`: One-line installer for AI tools
  - `install-global.sh`: Global installation script

## Working Components

1. **MCP Server** - Successfully starts and exposes MCP tools
2. **FreeCAD Connection** - Successfully connects to FreeCAD
3. **MCP Protocol** - Successfully implements the MCP protocol
4. **Command Line Installation** - Successfully installed as a command-line tool

## How to Run the MCP Server

There are multiple ways to run the MCP-FreeCAD server:

### 1. Using the Global Command (Recommended)
```bash
mcp-freecad
```

### 2. Using the Local Script
```bash
./mcp-freecad.sh
```

### 3. Running the Python Script Directly
```bash
python freecad_mcp_server.py
```

### 4. Using the One-Line Installer (for AI Tools)
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/mcp-freecad/main/mcp-freecad-installer.sh | bash
```

## Verifying the Server

To verify that the server is running correctly, you can use the MCP client:

```bash
python -m mcp.client python freecad_mcp_server.py
```

This should connect to the server and display the initialization response.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Command Not Found**: If the `mcp-freecad` command is not found, try:
   - Re-installing with `pip install -e .`
   - Adding `/usr/local/bin` to your PATH
   - Using the `./mcp-freecad.sh` script directly

2. **Connection Issues**: If the server fails to connect to FreeCAD:
   - Make sure FreeCAD is installed and accessible
   - Check the connection method in the config.json file
   - Try running with the `--debug` flag for more detailed logs

3. **MCP Protocol Errors**: If you see MCP protocol errors:
   - Ensure you have the correct version of the MCP package installed
   - Try installing required packages: `pip install trio`

## Next Steps

1. Implement more specialized FreeCAD tools in the MCP server
2. Add comprehensive testing for all MCP tools
3. Improve error handling and logging
4. Create detailed documentation for AI assistants on how to use the MCP server with FreeCAD
