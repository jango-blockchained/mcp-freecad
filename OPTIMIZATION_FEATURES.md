# MCP-FreeCAD Optimization Features

This document outlines the optimization features implemented in the MCP-FreeCAD integration project.

## 1. Caching System

The caching system improves performance by storing frequently accessed resources and responses:

- **Implementation**: Time-to-live (TTL) cache with key-based lookup
- **Features**:
  - Configurable TTL per entry
  - Size-limited cache to prevent memory overflow
  - Cache statistics tracking (hits, misses, hit rate)
  - Cache invalidation by key or pattern
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `GET /cache/stats`: View cache statistics and keys
  - `POST /cache/clear`: Clear all cached data
  - `DELETE /cache/item/{key}`: Remove specific item from cache

## 2. Recovery Mechanism

The recovery system improves reliability by handling transient failures:

- **Implementation**: Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- **Features**:
  - Configurable retry limits
  - Exponential backoff with maximum delay
  - Failure statistics tracking
  - Async and sync operation support
- **Usage**:
  - Used in API endpoints to handle FreeCAD connection issues
  - Used in tool execution to ensure reliable operation

## 3. Performance Monitoring

The performance monitoring system provides insights into server performance:

- **Implementation**: Metrics collection with timing information
- **Features**:
  - Request timing for all endpoints
  - Error tracking and aggregation
  - System resource monitoring (CPU, memory, disk)
  - Slow endpoint identification
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `GET /health`: Basic health check
  - `GET /health/detailed`: Detailed system information
  - `GET /diagnostics`: Complete performance overview
  - `GET /diagnostics/slow_endpoints`: Identify bottlenecks
  - `GET /diagnostics/errors`: Error analysis
  - `POST /diagnostics/reset`: Reset performance counters

## 4. Testing Utilities

Testing tools to verify optimization functionality:

- **test_optimization.py**: Comprehensive test script for optimization features
  - Tests health endpoints
  - Tests cache functionality
  - Tests performance monitoring
  - Includes stress testing capability

## Configuration

Optimization features can be configured in the `config.json` file:

```json
{
  "cache": {
    "enabled": true,
    "default_ttl": 30.0,
    "max_size": 100
  },
  "recovery": {
    "max_retries": 5,
    "retry_delay": 2.0,
    "backoff_factor": 1.5,
    "max_delay": 30.0
  },
  "performance": {
    "monitoring_enabled": true,
    "metrics_retention": 3600,
    "sample_rate": 1.0
  }
}
```

## Impact on Performance

- **Response Time**: Caching reduces response time for frequently accessed resources
- **Reliability**: Recovery mechanism improves system stability and reduces failures
- **Observability**: Performance monitoring provides insights into system health
- **Resource Usage**: Optimized to minimize CPU and memory overhead

## Future Improvements

- Add more sophisticated caching strategies (LRU, LFU)
- Implement distributed caching for multi-instance deployments
- Enhance recovery with more advanced circuit breaker patterns
- Integrate with external monitoring systems (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Add user-configurable alerting based on performance thresholds
