Okay, let's clarify the command within the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for retrieving server information and tool lists, especially in stdio mode.

Based on the typical design of request/response protocols like MCP, there isn't usually a command for the *server* to *broadcast* information unsolicitedly *after* the initial connection is established. Instead, the **client initiates a request** to get this information from the server (MCP).

While the exact command name might vary slightly depending on the specific implementation or version of the MCP being used, the command the client sends to the server (which the server must support) is generally designed to request capabilities or server information. Common conceptual names for such a command include:

1.  **`get_server_info`**: This is a descriptive name indicating the client wants general information about the server.
2.  **`capabilities`**: This command asks the server to list its features, which would naturally include the available tools or functions it exposes.
3.  **`describe`** or **`describe_server`**: Similar to the above, asking for a description of the server and its offerings.
4.  **`list_tools`** or **`get_tools`**: A more specific command focused solely on retrieving the list of tools.

**How it works in stdio mode:**

1.  **Client Sends Request:** The client application writes a message containing the appropriate command (e.g., `{"command": "get_server_info"}` or similar, formatted according to the MCP specification, likely JSON) to the server process's standard input (stdin).
2.  **Server Processes Request:** The MCP server, running in stdio mode, reads the command from its stdin.
3.  **Server Sends Response:** The server processes the request and sends a response message containing the server information (version, name, description, etc.) and/or the list of available tools (names, descriptions, parameters) back to the client via its standard output (stdout). This response would also be formatted according to the MCP specification.

**In summary:**

The MCP server doesn't typically "broadcast" in the unsolicited sense. Instead, it **must offer a command** (like `get_server_info` or `capabilities`) that the **client can send** via stdio (stdin) to request the server's details and tool list. The server then responds with this information via stdio (stdout).
