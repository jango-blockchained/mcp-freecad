# OpenRouter Async Models Error - FIXED

## Issue Summary
**Date**: 2025-06-10  
**Error**: TypeError when selecting OpenRouter provider in FreeCAD AI addon

## Problem Details
```
RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'OpenRouterProvider.get_available_models' was never awaited
TypeError: 'PySide2.QtWidgets.QComboBox.addItems' called with wrong argument types:
  PySide2.QtWidgets.QComboBox.addItems(coroutine)
```

**Root Cause**: OpenRouter provider's `get_available_models()` method was async, but the UI widget expected a synchronous call returning a list of strings.

## Fix Implemented

### 1. Made `get_available_models()` Synchronous ✅
**File**: `/freecad-ai/ai/providers/openrouter_provider.py`

**Before (Problematic)**:
```python
async def get_available_models(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    # Async API call that returned coroutine
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```python
def get_available_models(self) -> List[str]:
    """Get list of available models for UI compatibility."""
    return self.OPENROUTER_MODELS.copy()
```

### 2. Added Async Version for Advanced Use ✅
```python
async def get_available_models_async(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Get list of currently available models from OpenRouter API."""
    # Dynamic API fetching when needed
```

## Impact
- **Immediate**: OpenRouter provider selection no longer crashes the UI
- **Model Dropdown**: Now populates correctly with available models
- **Compatibility**: Matches pattern used by other providers (anthropic, google, openai)
- **No Regression**: Other providers continue to work normally
- **Future-Proof**: Async method available for when dynamic model fetching is needed

## Testing
The fix addresses the core async/sync mismatch that was preventing users from selecting OpenRouter as their AI provider. Users should now be able to:

1. Select OpenRouter from the provider dropdown
2. See available models populate in the model dropdown  
3. Configure OpenRouter settings without UI crashes
4. Use OpenRouter for AI conversations

## Files Modified
- `freecad-ai/ai/providers/openrouter_provider.py` - Fixed async/sync interface

## Task Status
- **BUGFIX_004**: Completed ✅
- **Related Tasks**: This builds on the provider service import fix from BUGFIX_003

This completes the provider-related fixes needed for stable OpenRouter operation in the FreeCAD AI addon.
