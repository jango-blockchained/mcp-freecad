## New Features in the Addon

### 1. Advanced Tools Tab
A new tab in the UI that provides access to:
- **Assembly Tools**: Create and manage assemblies
- **CAM Tools**: Computer-aided manufacturing operations
- **Rendering Tools**: Scene setup and rendering
- **Smithery Tools**: Fun blacksmithing-themed modeling tools

### 2. Resources Tab
A new tab providing access to:
- **Material Resources**: List materials, view library, apply materials
- **Constraint Resources**: (Coming soon) Constraint management
- **Measurement Resources**: (Coming soon) Advanced measurements

### 3. Enhanced Architecture
- Modular import system with fallback handling
- Asynchronous tool execution
- Resource providers for materials and constraints
- Event handling system for document and command events
- API layer for tool and resource management

## Benefits of the Extension

1. **More Comprehensive Toolset**: The addon now includes advanced manufacturing, assembly, and rendering tools
2. **Better Resource Management**: Materials and constraints can be managed through dedicated providers
3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Document and command events can be tracked and responded to
4. **API Layer**: Standardized API for tools and resources
5. **Future-Ready**: The modular architecture allows for easy addition of new tools and features

## Usage

The addon maintains its focus on AI-powered CAD assistance while expanding its capabilities with:
- Direct AI integration (Claude, Gemini, OpenRouter)
- MCP server support for Claude Desktop
- Extended tool palette for advanced operations
- Resource management for materials and constraints
- Event handling for responsive automation

The renaming to "FreeCAD AI" better reflects the addon's primary focus on AI-powered assistance, while the MCP (Model Context Protocol) remains as the underlying technology for external integrations.
